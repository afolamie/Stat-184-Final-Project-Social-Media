Social Media App Popularity & Exposure Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes social media usage data to determine which apps appear to have the most popularity and exposure. The goal is to compare platforms using usage and engagement indicators and summarize which apps stand out most clearly.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure

Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle dataset **“Social Media Usage Dataset(Applications)”** by **Bhadra Mohit**. The dataset contains app-level usage and engagement-style variables across several major platforms and is intended for exploring patterns in time, posts, likes, and follows (as described on the dataset page).
